                    <li>
                        <p class="question">Where is the data coming from?</p>
                        <p class="answer">The weatherstack API is licensing weather data from some of the largest weather stations and weather data providers in the world, all of which are closely monitored for consistency and data accuracy around the clock.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="question">How often is weather data refreshed?</p>
                        <p class="answer">Weather data returned by the API as well as weather forecast data always contains the most up-to-date weather information at the current point in time, updated in real-time.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Pricing is based on the number of monthly API requests allowed. Each time the weatherstack API service is used to look up a weather information, one API request is consumed. API errors are not counted towards your monthly quota.</p>

                        <p class="question">What happens if I exceed my API Request volume?</p>
                        <p class="answer">Users will be automatically notified via e-mail and on their Account Dashboard once at least 75%, 90%, and 100% of their monthly API Request allowance has been reached. After reaching 100% of the allowance, API access will be disabled.</p>

                        <p class="answer">The most decisive factor when it comes to your technical requirements is the number of monthly weather data requests you need to make per month. Other factors include HTTPS encryption, historical data, forecast data, and more.
